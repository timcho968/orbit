## ✍️ Changes in this fork

This branch includes my own modifications on top of the upstream project —
full list (in Russian and English): **[CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md)**. Highlights:

- **Webapp mode** from a home-screen shortcut: site opens fullscreen without
  browser UI, adblock and downloads work inside it
- Pin-to-home via the system dialog (`requestPinShortcut`)
- Back gesture works from the first swipe in webapp (navigation bar stays visible)
- Shared `DownloadHelper` for browser and webapp
- Live adblock status line on the start screen ("Total N requests blocked")
- Jelly-style bottom bar, stop button for stuck loads, edge-to-edge, dark `about:blank`

## ✨ Features

### 🛡️ 1. Ad Blocking
- **Embedded C++/Rust JNI Engine:** Powered by Brave Software's `adblock-rust` crate executing directly at native speed.
- **Live Blocking Stats:** Tapping the Shield icon opens a bottom sheet showing blocked item counts for the current page and total blocked requests.
- **Per-Site Protection Toggle:** Easily toggle adblocking ON/OFF for any website with a single tap (per-site allowlist).

### 🌐 2. Multi-Language Web Page Translation
- **Flexible Source & Target Languages:** Tap "Translate Page" from the overflow menu to translate any webpage.
- **Auto-Detection & System Locale Matching:** Source language is auto-detected; target language defaults to system language (supports English, Turkish, German, French, Spanish, Russian, Arabic, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Hindi, etc.) while keeping the webpage layout and links intact.

### 🔍 3. Dynamic Search Engine & Real-Time Suggestions
- Google is set as default (switchable to DuckDuckGo, Bing, Yandex, Brave, Startpage).
- Dynamic search bar hint automatically updates to reflect the chosen engine (*"Search with Google or type URL"*).
- Optional real-time OpenSearch autocompletion in Settings.

### 🌙 4. Full Material 3 Light/Dark Theme & Web Darkening
- Complete Material Design 3 Day/Night theme with synchronized status bar and navigation bar icon colors.
- **Independent Web Darkening:** Web pages are NOT forcibly darkened just because Dark Theme is on. Web darkening ("Force Dark Web") is an independent option in Settings > Appearance.

### 📌 5. Optional Tab Session Restore
- *"Restore open tabs"* setting under Settings > General automatically restores tabs and URLs when reopening the app (Disabled by default).

### 📜 6. Auto-Hiding Toolbars on Scroll
- Scrolling down automatically slides the top Omnibox and bottom navigation bar out of view for immersive full-screen reading. Scrolling up smoothly restores toolbars.

## ⚡ Memory & Performance Optimization

Orbit is meticulously engineered for minimal resource consumption and peak fluidity:

- **Ultra-Low Memory Footprint:** Consumes only **~78 MB RAM total** (~0.078 GB).
- **Single Live WebView Architecture:** Background tabs are serialized into memory states (`saveState()`) to free renderer memory, waking only when selected.
- **Compiled Engine Binary (`engine.bin`):** Pre-compiles 4 MB filter rule sets into a binary cache to eliminate cold-start parsing delays.
- **Overdraw & Pre-Warming:** Off-main-thread SQLite DB & WebView provider initialization.
